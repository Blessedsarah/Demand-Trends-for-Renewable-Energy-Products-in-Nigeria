## Project Overview
This project offers a comprehensive analysis of market demand for renewable energy products in Nigeria over time, including batteries, inverters, solar panels, solar generators, solar fans, biogas, and wind turbines. The objectives are to:  
- Identify the top three most in-demand products.
- Analyze seasonal demand variations.
- Pinpoint geographic hotspots for renewable energy demand.  

The insights aim to guide strategic decision-making for marketing and distribution priorities for Renergy Hub.

## Data Source and Methodology
For this analysis, we used data from Google Trends, which shows the popularity of search terms. Google Trends assigns a popularity score on a scale of 0 to 100, reflecting the relative interest in a search term. This tool was essential for capturing demand trends for renewable energy products, as it highlights search activity and interest over time, offering insight into geographic and seasonal variations.
Here's a refined version:

### Tools Used: 
- Excel, Pivot Table, Power Query, VLOOKUP, Charts, and Graphs  

We downloaded the data and proceeded with cleaning and preparation. The data was then merged into two separate tables: one for yearly data and another for regional data. VLOOKUP was utilized to assign states to their respective geopolitical regions, ensuring accurate regional classification. The final analysis was presented using Pivot Tables, charts, and graphs to visualize insights effectively. 

## Key Findings
#### 1. Most In-Demand Products:
After analysing various search terms, the top three most in-demand renewable energy products are:
- Battery
- Solar Generator
- Inverter

These products reflect the highest levels of interest in renewable energy solutions, as indicated by their Google Trends popularity scores.

## Insights
- **Product Demand:** Batteries, solar generators, and inverters are highly sought-after, indicating that they should be prioritised in marketing campaigns.
- **Regional Interest:** The South-West zone, particularly in states like Ogun, Ondo and Oyo, represents a geographic hotspot for renewable energy products. Prioritising this area may yield higher engagement and conversion rates.
- **Growth Over Time:** The steady rise in interest for solar-based products aligns with broader trends towards sustainable energy solutions, suggesting an increasing market for these products in Nigeria. There's also a growing awareness of renewable energy solutions and their benefits.

## Recommendations
- Focus promotional efforts on the South-West zone, especially in Borno, Oyo, Ogun and Ondo states.
- Emphasize marketing around peak periods of interest to capitalise on seasonal demand variations.
- Given the declining interest in biogas, Renergy Hub may benefit from concentrating resources on the growth of solar-based products, which are gaining traction.

#### Disclaimer: While Google Trends provides valuable insights, it is essential to interpret the results cautiously, as the relevance and reliability of the data source may vary.
